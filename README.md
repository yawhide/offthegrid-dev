# offthegrid-dev
My submission for Ginger.io!

I was planning to add a cron job using Heroku Scheduler but I don't have any more time to put into this side project as my assignments started to pile in again. My cron job was going to call "get_facebook_events()" and "update_highscore_cache()"(these two methods are in cron.py and views.py respectively) every hour to update the events and highscore.

I really enjoyed this side project as I learned a lot of django so thank you for the opportunity! (Never used it before)
